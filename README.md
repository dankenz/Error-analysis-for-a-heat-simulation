# Error-analysis-for-a-heat-simulation
In this project i made a heat equation simulation and mapped the error and the timing of the program in wolfram mathematica.
For the solution i used the Runge Kutta method of third order and compared with the standard NDSolve from mathematica.
From the Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation


The heat equation, along with variants thereof, is also important in many fields of science and applied mathematics. In probability theory, the heat equation is connected with the study of random walks and Brownian motion via the Fokker–Planck equation. The infamous Black–Scholes equation of financial mathematics is a small variant of the heat equation, and the Schrödinger equation of quantum mechanics can be regarded as a heat equation in imaginary time. In image analysis, the heat equation is sometimes used to resolve pixelation and to identify edges. Following Robert Richtmyer and John von Neumann's introduction of "artificial viscosity" methods, solutions of heat equations have been useful in the mathematical formulation of hydrodynamical shocks. Solutions of the heat equation have also been given much attention in the numerical analysis literature, beginning in the 1950s with work of Jim Douglas, D.W. Peaceman, and Henry Rachford Jr.

There are 2 separate files called "time used" and "Total error" that are the graphs obtained by the program
The mathematica notebook file is the same as the pdf file in case you cant open it.
